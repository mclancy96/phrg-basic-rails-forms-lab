  TODO: Create your form here!

  Your form should:
  - Use Rails form_with helper with the @team model
  - Have fields for: name, coach, pg, sg, pf, sf, c
  - Have a submit button (any text or styling is fine)
  - Use proper nested naming (e.g., team[name], team[coach], etc.)

  Hint: Use form_with helper with a model object
